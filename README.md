# Imperial College London ATES Assessment Tool

An open-source probabilistic assessment tool for Aquifer Thermal Energy Storage (ATES) and Groundwater Heating & Cooling (GHWC) systems.

This project replicates and extends the functionality of Oracle Crystal Ball in a fully open-source Python package, featuring deterministic calculations, Monte Carlo simulation, statistical reporting, and sensitivity analysis â€” all accessible via a Streamlit-based interface.

---

## Features

- Deterministic and probabilistic ATES system performance analysis
- Monte Carlo simulation with multiple distribution types
- Statistical outputs: mean, standard deviation, percentiles
- Sensitivity analysis with parameter importance ranking
- Case saving in three modes: Parameters Only, Parameters + Results, Full State
- Interactive interface built with Streamlit

## Installation

### Step 0: Install Python (if not already installed)

This tool requires **Python 3.8 or higher**.

If you do not already have Python installed, please download it from the official website:
- [Python Downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

During installation, make sure to check the option **"Add Python to PATH"** (on Windows).

For Mac users, Python 3 is often preinstalled. You can check by running in terminal:
```bash
python3 --version
```

If you are completely new to Python, please follow this official guide to learn how to run Python programs: [Python Tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/)

### Step 1: Set up a working environment (recommended)

It is strongly recommended to use a virtual environment to avoid dependency conflicts.

Create and activate a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv .venv

# On Mac/Linux
source .venv/bin/activate

# On Windows
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

### Step 2: Install the ATES tool

#### Option 1: Clone from GitHub
```bash
git clone https://github.com/esemsc-yy2923/ates-assessment-tool.git
cd ates-assessment-tool
pip install -e .
```

#### Option 2: Install directly from GitHub
```bash
pip install "git+https://github.com/esemsc-yy2923/ates-assessment-tool.git"
```

## Usage

After completing installation, you can run the tool from your terminal:

**Run the main assessment tool (Streamlit app):**
```bash
ates-tool
```
By default, the Streamlit app will open in your browser at http://localhost:8501/.

**Run the validation framework:**
```bash
ates-validate
```

If the command is not found, make sure the installation step was successful.

Alternatively, you can run directly with Python:
```bash
python -m tool.launch
```

## Saving Cases

The tool supports three case formats:

**Parameters Only**
- Includes ATES parameters and probability distributions only.
- Use cases: parameter backup, sharing, template creation.

**Parameters + Results**
- Adds deterministic results, system modes, and Monte Carlo summary.
- Use cases: validation, documentation, scenario comparison.

**Full State (Report)**
- Adds complete statistical analysis and sensitivity results.
- Use cases: comprehensive reports, risk assessment.

## Development

To contribute:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/new-function
# make changes
git add .
git commit -m "Add new feature"
git push origin feature/new-function
```

Recommendation: use a development branch and merge into main only after testing.
